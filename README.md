# **Project Description**

>This project was project was mainly focused on database work within java and how to import and export tables; as well as editing them during runtime. More specifically, this application was intended to be a mockup of what a _**online shopping store**_ would look like! Full functionality including different ways to add things to your cart, and different GUIS for things such as: logging in, pending orders, registration forms, catalog windows, and more!

# **Techincal Description**

>All database work is handled using [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/), a fairly simple, open source, relational database. Data management being handled on a 3rd party server made data management a lot easier. Locally hosting a database always turns out to be a mediocre idea. Simple connection work using DriverManager and JDBC made it easy to connect to a 3rd party server. For the frontend, we used Java Swing, which is native to the JFC (Java Foundation Classes). Working with Java Swing made the front end a breeze! There are many different paneling/labeling options that Java Swing provides. Moreover, when going back to the project a more modern GUI framework should have been used.
